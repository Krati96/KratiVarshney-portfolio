            <h1>Values, Types, and Operators</h1>
            <p>
                Inside the computer’s world, there is only data. You can read data, modify data, create new data—but that which isn’t data cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus fundamentally alike.<br/>

                Bits are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zeros and ones.
                <h4>VALUES : </h4>
                To be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost, we must separate them into chunks that represent pieces of information. In a JavaScript environment, those chunks are called <b>values</b>. Some values are numbers, some values are pieces of text, some values are functions, and so on.</p><br>
                <h4>Numbers : </h4>
                Values of the number type are, unsurprisingly, numeric values. In a JavaScript program, they are written as follows: 11 <br>
                Fractional numbers are written by using a dot : 9.81 <br>
                For very big or very small numbers, you may also use scientific notation by adding an e (for exponent), followed by the exponent of the number : 2.998e8 <br>
                That is 2.998 * 108 = 299,800,000. <br>
